# laravel-billing
Laravel Billing is a composer-installable Laravel package that provides world-class, gateway-agnostic billing, plans, subscriptions, invoices, multi-currency support, usage metering and a Livewire-powered admin UI. The goal: a drop-in, extensible billing system any Laravel app can adopt — open source, modular, and future-proof.
